# todo-jwt-auth-pern

Wanted to experiment with auth using jwt tokens. This was an old project that I recently uploaded. Used Heroku for backend and netlify for frontend. Didn't pay much attention to UI but the app has some nice logic behind backend and frontenden. 

### You can see the project demo below
